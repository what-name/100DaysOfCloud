## 👨🏻‍💻Chris Nagy's Cloud Journey

👋🏻Hey, my name is Chris Nagy. I first heard about "the Cloud" 5 months ago. Now I'm AWS Certified and collaborating on creating this challenge!

I started this challenge because the best way to learn about something is to simply get your hands dirty. The consistency and hands-on experience provide a learning path and speed that is unmatched.

After I complete this challenge, I aim to have a skill level increase of at least 420%🙃

## Stepping out the door

- [X] ☁️ 1 > 16.07.20 - Hands-on with AWS Amplify. Completed the [GraphQL Getting Started guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/js). It really isn't that difficult, but also much more complicated and powerful than I thought! `amplify init 100daysofcloud && amplify publish😉`
- [X] ☁️ 2 > 17.07.20 - Spent the whole afternoon figuring out how to continue working on a deployed Amplify app. It is not as easy as it sounds. I know a lot more about Amplify than I knew before, but still stuck🙃
- [X] ☁️ 3 > 18.07.20 - I learned so much about Amplify and realized that the currently deployed app has a problem. Most pieces finnaly clicked and a new app will be deployed! Also learned and understood how OAUTH2 and OIDC works.
- [ ] ☁️ 4 > 19.07.20 - Amplify has coupled but also decoupled frontend and backend environments. The CLI is used to work with the backend and the console for the frontend (as far as I can tell). Also added a project idea to the 100DaysOfCloudIdeas repo [about CloudFormation](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloudIdeas/blob/master/Projects/OPS/OPS01/OPS01-AWS100.md)💪🏻
